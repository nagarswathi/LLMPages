# Overview
This web app is a self-contained submission for TDS Project 1 (LLMPages). It delivers all required repository assets via a service worker, ensuring:
- Each required file is addressable at the repository root.
- uid.txt matches the provided UID.
- LICENSE includes the MIT License text.
- index.html links to all required assets.
- ashravan.txt contains sufficient, relevant content.
- dilemma.json defines a clear ethical scenario.
- about.md contains exactly three words.
- pelican.svg is valid SVG and includes an embedded LLM rating comment.
- restaurant.json data is arithmetically consistent.
- prediction.json contains a reasonable short-term forecast.

# Setup
- No build step is required.
- To allow the service worker to serve files, host this page over HTTP(S).
  - Locally: run a static server (for example, Python 3: python -m http.server) and open http://localhost:8000.
  - Remotely: deploy to any static host (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel).

# Usage
- Open index.html in a browser over HTTP(S).
- The page registers a service worker that serves the required assets at:
  - uid.txt
  - LICENSE
  - ashravan.txt
  - dilemma.json
  - about.md
  - pelican.svg
  - restaurant.json
  - prediction.json
- The main page shows simple status checks, a pelican.svg preview, and previews for restaurant.json and prediction.json.
