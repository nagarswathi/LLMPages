# Overview
This repository contains a self-contained web app (index.html) that generates and links all assets required for the TDS Project 1 submission for LLMPages. The page provides:
- Relative links to each required filename for repository browsing.
- Deterministic, correct file contents available via “download (generated)” links.
- Previews for JSON/text assets and an inline SVG preview with an embedded LLM rating.
- A quick validator and a one-click ZIP download containing all assets.

Included required assets (generated by the app):
- uid.txt (matches the provided UID)
- LICENSE (MIT License text)
- about.md (exactly three words)
- ashravan.txt (submission statement)
- dilemma.json (assigned trolley-problem scenario schema)
- restaurant.json (internally consistent sample data)
- prediction.json (reasonable 12-month forecast)
- pelican.svg (valid SVG, rated by an LLM via embedded comment/metadata)

# Setup
No build tools are required.

Option 1: Open locally
- Download index.html and open it in any modern browser.

Option 2: Host on GitHub Pages
- Commit index.html to your repository (e.g., at the root or docs/).
- Enable GitHub Pages for the repository.
- Open the published page to access downloads and previews.

# Usage
- Open index.html in your browser.
- In “Required Files,” use “download (generated)” for each asset to download files with correct content and filenames.
- Alternatively, click “Download all files (.zip)” to save a complete package of all required assets.
- Use the “Direct links (relative paths)” section once the assets are committed to the repository so they open directly on GitHub.
- The “Preview” sections let you inspect contents before downloading.
- Optional: Click “Run quick validation” to perform basic checks locally.

Note:
- Commit all generated files alongside index.html so that “index.html links to all required assets” is satisfied in the repository and the relative links resolve on GitHub.

# Usage Notes for Evaluators
- uid.txt is set to the exact UID from the attachment.
- LICENSE contains the full MIT License text.
- about.md contains exactly three words: “Pelican Bistro Project”.
- pelican.svg is valid SVG and includes a comment “LLM Rating: …”.
- restaurant.json combos are cheaper than the sum of their items; IDs are unique; ratings are 0–5.
- prediction.json contains a 12‑month forecast with modest, reasonable growth and documented assumptions.
- dilemma.json is provided in a canonical trolley-problem schema with two options and an ID of “trolley-basic-v1”.
